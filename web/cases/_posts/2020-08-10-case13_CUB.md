Investigation of HVAC operation strategies for office buildings during COVID-19 pandemic
</h1>
</div>

<div class="text">
The objective of the case study was to compare different HVAC operation strategies to mitigate indoor virus, including MERV 10, MERV 13, and HEPA filtration, as well as supply of 100% outdoor air into the building. The strategies were compared in terms of indoor virus concentration, predicted number of infections, and energy consumption. The mitigation strategies were studied for the first floor of a five zone, medium office building located in Denver, CO. The results showed ASHRAE-recommended MERV 13 filtration reduces the average virus concentration by about 10% when compared to MERV 10 filtration, with an increase in site energy consumption of about 3%. In contrast, the use of 100% outdoor air reduces the average indoor concentration by about an additional 1% compared to MERV 13 filtration, but significantly increases heating energy consumption. Use of HEPA filtration increases the average indoor concentration and energy consumption compared to MERV 13 filtration due to the high resistance of the HEPA filter.
