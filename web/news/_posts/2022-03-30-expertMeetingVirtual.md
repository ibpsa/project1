The 9th Expert Meeting of IBPSA Project 1 has been held on March 28 and March 30, 2022.
This was the last Expert Meeting.
Instead of another Expert Meeting at the end of the 5 year project period,
we will conduct kick-off meetings of continuing tasks this fall.

The meeting hosted a presentation from Prof. Luigi Vanfretti who discussed
his experience in developing and using OpenIPSL in the power industry.
The slides are available at [https://github.com/ibpsa/project1/blob/master/meetings/2022-03-28-expert-meeting-virtual/2022_IBPSA_OpenIPSL.pdf](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1/blob/master/meetings/2022-03-28-expert-meeting-virtual/2022_IBPSA_OpenIPSL.pdf)
and the recording of the presentation is at [https://youtu.be/IKdECHSO9wc](https://youtu.be/IKdECHSO9wc).

In fall, we will conduct kick-off meetings of the activities whose continuation are currently being organized.
This will include work on the Modelica IBPSA Library development, on BOPTEST, and on the DESTEST District Energy Model validation.
