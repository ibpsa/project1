The 5th IBPSA Project 1 In-Person Expert Meeting in Montreal is postponed, tentatively
to the week of October 12, 2020. In its place, we will have a 3 hour web meeting on May 6, 2020, 8am to 11am Pacific Daylight Saving Time.
We will inform about the new date during summer
at the [project mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ibpsa-project-1-announcements)

The work package leaders have met and decided that from a public health and a planning
standpoint, it is best to postpone the Montreal Expert Meeting due to the Corona virus.
In its place, we will do a web meeting on May 6, 2020, 8am to 11am Pacific Daylight Saving Time.
The agenda and dial-in instructions will be posted at the [meetings page](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1/wiki/Meetings) in the next days. 

We plan to hold the Montreal meeting tentatively in the week of October 12, 2020. We will provide
an update about the fall meeting in June or July on the [project mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ibpsa-project-1-announcements).

We made this decision already now so participants can update their travel plans accordingly.

If you have already registered and paid for the meeting, please keep the registration
for now. In the next few weeks, we will send an update to the
[project mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ibpsa-project-1-announcements)
regarding the easiest procedure to keep or cancel the existing registration.
