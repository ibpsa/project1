On May 6, 2020, the IBPSA Project 1 held its 5th Expert Meeting.
The meeting was held as a web meeting.
It was attended by 50 people.

<!--excerpt-->
Originally, the meeting was supposed to take place in Montreal, Canada.
During the meeting, each work package provided an updated about
past and future work. These updates were followed by a moderated
group discussion.

A survey showed that the preference for future virtual expert meetings
will be a meeting over 2 days with 3 hours of meetings each day. This format will
allow to have breakout sessions.

For the slides of the meeting and its various breakout sessions,
