Learn about the first collaborative five-year IBPSA-World project called "BIM/GIS and Modelica framework for building and community energy system design and operation," which IBPSA-World approved to be conducted under its umbrella starting in 2017. This project will continue parts of the five-year IEA EBC Annex 60 project in which 41 institutes from 18 countries collaboratively develop free open-source software based on the Modelica, Functional Mockup Interface and Building Information Modeling standards. Presenters discuss the goals for the IBPSA project, explain the rationale for selecting these technologies, present case studies and discuss how to participate in this project.
