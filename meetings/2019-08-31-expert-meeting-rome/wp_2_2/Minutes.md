**Discussion**
-   Preliminary test implementations by RWTH E3D done regarding Space Boundary algorithms
-   No further implementations by other parties yet due to lack of ressources.
-   Agreement on starting with first modules like brep creation in theoretical and later in implemented form
-   Inclusion of process model view checking in tool chain
-  Collection of rules to be implemented in such a MVDXML
-   Next telefonce conference in october
