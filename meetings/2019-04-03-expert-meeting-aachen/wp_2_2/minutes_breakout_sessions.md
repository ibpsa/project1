# IBPSA Project 1 Aachen Expert Meeting

Aachen, April 3-4, 2019

***Present***: ...

***Excused***: ...

BIM
-	Geometry processing
	o	Work packages: defining Input (IFC) and output (IFC+SB), base code (repository + test files), algorithmic review and coding
	o	Next steps: Testing of geometry algorithms
	o	Possible synergies between groups:
			E3D (E. Fichter), KIT (A. Geiger): Algorithms regarding IFC to Connection Model to Space
			UDT (C. Nytsch-Geusen), TUC (G. Giannakis): Algorithms regarding Space to 2ndSB
			Tsinghua (J. Lin)					
-	HVAC processing
	o	Circuit analysis
	o	Speedup of code processing

MVD
-	Pragmatic approach
-	Action item (led by K.-H. Häfele)
	o	Review, consolidate and merge existing MVD parts
	o	Setup of Wiki, GIT

Controls@BIM
-	Discussion about reasonableness of linked data to connect different building domains. Would be benefitial, still open questions because of building's complexity
-	Action item (led by Dominik Schlütter, E3D)
	o	Preparation of point paper on semantic web with use case considering
			BIM model organization
			Hydraulic schema
			Controls (CDL)
			Different topology representations (BRICK, etc.)
			State machines
			Classification systems (ETIM, eCl@ss, etc.)
			Linking by semantic web using RDF
	o	Participants: J. O'Donnell, D. Jansen, K.-H. Häfele, D. Schlütter, C. van Treeck, M. Wetter
